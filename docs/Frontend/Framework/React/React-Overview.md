# React Learning Path

## Phase 1: React Foundations

**Goal:** Understand the motivation behind React, JSX, component-based architecture.

### Topics

- ✅ Why React? (Simple dev flow, Virtual DOM, JSX, Flexibility)
- ✅ What is JSX? (Syntax, Usage, Conditional rendering, Attributes)
- ✅ ReactDOM & Virtual DOM (How it works, why it matters)
- ✅ Setting up with Vite (Recommended)
  - Watch "Vite in 100s" → Follow "Vite + React Setup"

### Practice

- Create a basic Vite + React app
- Render a static component with JSX

---

## Phase 2: Components & Styling

**Goal:** Learn component structure, state/props, and choose a styling system.

### Topics

- ✅ Functional vs Class components (Start with Functional)
- ✅ Props & Events
- ✅ Basic State with useState
- ✅ Component lifecycle (Conceptual only for now)
- ✅ Styling options:
  - TailwindCSS (Recommended)
  - Try others briefly (Bootstrap, MUI, AntD)

### Practice

- Build a "Profile Card" component styled with Tailwind
- Make props-driven reusable components

---

## Phase 3: React Core Hooks

**Goal:** Master React hooks and side effects.

### Topics

- ✅ useState, useEffect (with examples)
- ✅ useRef, useMemo, useCallback
- ✅ Write custom hooks (start simple)
- ✅ Intro to useContext

### Practice

- Todo app with useState
- Fetch data and render with useEffect
- Create a timer with useRef

---

## Phase 4: Routing & State Management

**Goal:** Build multi-page apps and manage deeper state.

### Topics

- ✅ React Router (Course + Lazy loading routes)
- ✅ Prop Drilling problem
- ✅ Context API (Shared state)
- ✅ Zustand (Try as Redux alternative)
- ✅ Form handling (Formik + Yup)

### Practice

- Multi-page app (Home/About/Product)
- Theme switcher with global state (Context or Zustand)
- Simple form with Formik + Yup validation

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Patterns & Performance

**Goal:** Structure scalable apps and optimize performance.

### Topics

- ✅ Pure Functions
- ✅ HOC, Render Props, Container Pattern
- ✅ Debounce / Throttle
- ✅ Code Splitting
- ✅ React Profiler
- ✅ Virtualisation (long list rendering)

### Practice

- Build HOC to handle loading states
- Optimize large list with virtualization
- Code split route-based chunks

---

## Phase 6: Ecosystem, Testing, and Frameworks

**Goal:** Prepare for real-world app development.

### Topics

- ✅ Testing (Jest, Cypress)
- ✅ Production build vs Dev
- ✅ Tools: React Helmet, Storybook
- ✅ Frameworks Overview:
  - Next.js (recommended next phase)
  - Remix, Astro, Gatsby (just explore for now)

### Practice

- Write tests for a component (Jest)
- Setup routing + lazy loading + metadata (Helmet)
- Prepare Vite app for production
