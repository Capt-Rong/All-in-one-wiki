# Debounce

## Metaphor: The Lazy Doorman

Imagine a doorman who's supposed to open the door every time someone rings the bell. But to avoid opening the door too often, he waits a few seconds to see if more people come â€” and only opens the door once, after the last ring.

This is debounce: Only do the action after things have stopped happening for a while.

## Definition

Debouncing is a technique to limit how often a function is called, especially during rapid, repeated events like:

- Typing in a search box
- Resizing the window
- Scrolling

It waits for a pause in events before running your function.

## How It Works

```ts
thisfunction debounce(callback, delay) {
  let timerId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timerId);
    timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      callback.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

```ts
const searchBox = document.querySelector("input");

const debouncedValidate = debounce((value) => {
  console.log("Validating:", value);
}, 300);

searchBox?.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  const value = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value;
  debouncedValidate(value); // only runs after user pauses typing
});
```
